# ACM Artifact Badges

We are applying for the following badges:

- Functional — our project is [well-documented](./docs) and our tools and queries have been validated during user interviews.
- Reusable — our project is reusable, particularly as our data can be explored with [existing tools](https://neo4j.com) and our scripts/queries can easily be modified. Our scripts and tools have significant functionality beyond basic data analysis (i.e. interactive explorations, image generation modules, full library of analysis scripts).
- Available — our data is open access and our repository is available [here](https://github.com/ubcdlab/pr-issue-topology-project).
