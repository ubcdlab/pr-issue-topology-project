# Diversity Sample

To generate a new diversity sample with a different threshold, modify the constant `DEFAULT_NUMERIC_METRIC_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` and file path `file` in `write_to_csv` to new values. The results of the script will be written to CSV in `unified_json/`.

To fetch more detailed node information on the returned output, match the node number returned in the CSV to a node ID in graph JSON files in `data/`. These numbers also correspond to node numbers directly on GitHub.
