# Cypher Queries

This folder contains the Cypher queries to return the nodes associated with each workflow type. To use these queries, import the [database dump](https://osf.io/3kexy) into your Neo4J instance, and drag and drop the queries over the GUI.

Note that some of these scripts were not used in the final workflow type definitions.
